The Car Price Predictor is a machine learning project aimed at predicting the price of a car based on various features such as its make, model, year, mileage, engine capacity, fuel type, and other characteristics. This project leverages regression techniques to provide accurate price predictions, helping users estimate the value of a car they are interested in selling or purchasing.

Key Features:
Data Collection and Cleaning:
Collect data from various sources containing car details and their corresponding prices. Clean the dataset by handling missing values, outliers, and encoding categorical variables like car make, model, and fuel type.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Analyze the dataset to understand the relationships between features and car prices using visualization tools like matplotlib and seaborn. Investigate correlations between car age, mileage, and engine capacity with the car’s price.

Feature Engineering:
Extract new features from the existing dataset, such as the car’s age (current year - manufacturing year) and other relevant variables. Normalize or scale features for better model performance.

Model Selection:
Choose regression models such as Linear Regression, Random Forest Regressor, or Gradient Boosting Regressor to predict the car prices. Train the model using historical car sales data and fine-tune it for optimal performance.

Evaluation Metrics:
Evaluate the model’s performance using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE), R-squared, and Mean Absolute Error (MAE). Use techniques like cross-validation to ensure the model generalizes well to unseen data.

Deployment (Optional):
Deploy the trained model as a web app using Streamlit or Flask, allowing users to input car details and receive price predictions. The interface could allow for easy data entry with dropdowns and input boxes for different car features.

Tools and Technologies:
Programming Languages: Python
Libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn
Modeling Techniques: Linear Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting
Deployment: Streamlit or Flask (optional)
This project is useful for people in the car resale market, dealers, and potential buyers looking to get an accurate estimate of car prices.
